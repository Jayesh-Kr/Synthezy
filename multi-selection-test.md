## Multi-Selection Drag Test

### Test Steps:
1. **Draw multiple shapes**: Create 2-3 rectangles, circles, or other shapes on the canvas
2. **Select multiple elements**: Use marquee selection (drag a rectangle) or Ctrl+A to select all
3. **Verify selection indicators**: Check that selected elements show blue dashed borders
4. **Test group drag**: Click and drag any selected element to move the entire group
5. **Verify group movement**: All selected elements should move together maintaining relative positions

### Expected Behavior:
- When dragging a selected element that's part of a multi-selection, ALL selected elements move together
- The relative distances between elements remain constant during movement
- Movement is smooth without jumping or position drift

### Current Implementation Status:
✅ Multi-selection logic implemented
✅ Visual indicators (blue dashed borders) working
✅ Group movement delta calculation implemented
✅ Initial positions stored for group movement
✅ Mouse event handlers updated for multi-selection

### Key Code Locations:
- **Mouse Down**: `useCanvas.jsx` lines 120-140 (checks if element is in selection)
- **Mouse Move**: `useCanvas.jsx` lines 200-230 (handles group movement)
- **Mouse Up**: `useCanvas.jsx` lines 290-310 (cleans up after movement)

If group movement isn't working, check:
1. Are elements properly selected (blue borders visible)?
2. Is the clicked element part of the selection?
3. Are console errors present?
4. Is the `initialSelectedElements` array properly populated?
